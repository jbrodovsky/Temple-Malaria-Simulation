# (PART\*) Geospatial Data {-}

# Introduction

A key part of the simulation is the spatial component that allows for increased realism due to the spatial heterogeneity that is introduced. However, ensuring that the spatial data is prepared correctly for the simulation can be a challenge since it needs to be done for each country that is simulated. This chapter will walk the reader through the process of preparing the spatial data for a country, using Kenya as an example for the process.

The first step in preparing the geospatial data is to gather all of the relevant sources, this typically includes:

1. Political boundaries - national and sub-national
2. Population
3. Malaria prevalence
4. Travel or friction surface

Possible sources of this data is included in the appendix while Figure \@ref(fig:gisworkflow-png) offers a summary workflow of raster production.

# Raster Preperation

## Determining the Projection

Once all of the relevant geospatial data has been collected, the first step is determining the *datum* (the frame of reference for measuring locations on the Earth) and *projection* (the method used to portray the spherical coordinates on a flat surface). A useful starting point for this is [epsg.io](https://epsg.io/), which maintains a database of over 6,000 coordinate systems. 

A typical starting point is to enter the name of the country, which will return a list of all of the relevant records (see Figure \@ref(fig:gisepsgiosearch-png)). Typically, for the purposes of the simulation, using the appropriate Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone projection on the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) datum will provide a reasonable level of accuracy for the simulation. Although large countries may overlap multiple zones, which case the bounding of the projection should be checked to ensure that it covers the majority the country (see Figure \@ref(fig:gisepsgiobounding-png)). Once an appropriate datum and projection has been identified, make a note of it along with the Well-Known ID (WKID) as part of the project documentation since this will be used in the preparation of all of the geospatial data for the simulation.

```{r gisepsgiosearch-png, fig.cap="The results of a search for \"kenya\" on epsg.io", out.width = "450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis_epsg_io_search.png")
```

```{r gisepsgiobounding-png, fig.cap="The details page for Arc 1960 / UTM zone 37N on epsg.io. Note the Well-Known ID (WKID) that appears at the top of the page (EPSG:21097) as well as the bounding box that appears over the map of Kenya.", out.width = "450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis_epsg_io_bounding.png")
```

Once the projection has been determined and data gathered, start by creating a new project in ArcGIS Pro via `New Project > Map` for this example call the project `Kenya`, set the location to a folder such as `C:\GIS\`, and make sure `Create a new folder for this project` is checked. This will create a new project with the default map of the United States (see Figure \@ref(fig:gisdefaultmap-png)). Start by removing the `World Topographic Map` and `World Hillshade` base maps by right clicking on them under `Drawing Order` and selecting `Remove`. You should now have an empty map with no contents listed.

```{r gisdefaultmap-png, fig.cap="ArcGIS Pro with the default map of the United States", out.width = "450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis_default_map.png")
```

We will now set the coordinate system for the map. Start by right clicking on `Map` under `Drawing Order` and selecting `Properties`, this will load a new window titled `Map Properties: Map`. Click on `Coordinate Systems` on the left hand side of the window, this will display the current coordinate system for the map. By default `WGS 1984 Web Mercator (auxiliary sphere)` is used, but we want to set the map to the coordinate system system selected for the country we are working with. Locate the `Search` box under the `Current Z` box and enter the WKID value identified on epsg.io - using Kenya as our example this would be `21097`. A valid WKID should only return a single entry, in this case `Arc 1960 UTM Zone 37N` (see \@ref(fig:giscoordinatesystem-png)). Make sure the new coordinate system is listed under the `Current XY` and click `OK`.^[ Since the simulation models everything as a flat plane, it is unlikely that `Current Z` will ever be set to anything.] The default coordinate system has now been set for the map.

```{r giscoordinatesystem-png, fig.cap="Setting the new coordinate system in ArcGIS Pro", out.width = "450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis_coordinate_system.png")
```

## Preparing the District Raster

Next, we need to load the administrative boundaries for the country and prepare 1) raster data that can be used by the simulation, and 2) a comma separated value (CSV) file that can be used to map the district identification value (i.e., `district id`) assigned when creating the raster data, to the name of the district. 

Start by finding the project directory created by ArcGIS, in this case it is `C:\GIS\Kenya` and create a new folder called `data` and one called `simulation`. The `data` folder will be used for storing any data files that are downloaded. Next, locate the administrative boundaries for the country.^[ For Kenya, these were found on the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HBX) by searching for "kenya" at https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-ken. Note that an advantage of using data from HBX is that the data is open access under the Creative Commons Attribution for Intergovernmental Organisations, this is relevant when reproducing shapefile data in maps used in publications.] Typically shapefiles are distributed as a compressed file, decompress the file into the `data` directory and have ArcGIS refresh the folder listing by right clicking on home folder and selecting `Refresh` or pressing the `[F5]` key. You should see something similar to Figure \@ref(fig:gisadminshapefiles-png).

```{r gisadminshapefiles-png, fig.cap="Refreshed listing of all of the shapefiles in the data directory in ArcGIS Pro", out.width = "450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis_admin_shapefiles.png")
```

Next, right click on `Map` under the `Drawing Order` panel and select `New Group Layer`, an entry called "New Group Layer" will appear. Double check on the `New Group Layer` and enter "Administrative Boundaries" as the `Name` in the `Layer Properties: New Group Layer` dialog that appears. Click `OK` and under the `Drawing Order` panel you should have an entry called `Map` with an entry called `Administrative Boundaries` below it. 

Now, locate the administrative levels zero (or national boundary), one, and two in the `data` folder of the `Catalog` panel and drag them under the `Administrative Boundaries`. Right click on `Administrative Boundaries` and select `Zoom To Layer` you should now have a map similar to Figure \@ref(fig:gisadminlayers-png).

```{r gisadminlayers-png, fig.cap="The apperance of the map after all shapefiles have been added. Note that the top most layer -- the national boundry -- is covering all of the other layers", out.width = "450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis_admin_layers.png")
```

At this point we could start creating the raster files, but first we should adjust the appearance of the shapefiles to make them easier to work with. Start by renaming them by either double clicking on the layer and changing the name in the `Layer Properties` dialog that appears, or single clicking on the layer name and editing it directly in the `Drawing Order` panel.^[ One suggested format is the country name followed by "Admin NUMBER", or "Kenya - Admin Zero" in the case of our example.] 

Next, we will adjust the symbology that is being used to render the layers so that we can see them all. Start by right clicking on the administrative level zero layer selecting `Symbology`, the `Symbology` panel should appear on the right. Click on the symbol and in the gallery that appears, select `Black Outline (2pts)`. The map should now refresh with the national border in bold and the administrative level one appearing (see Figure \@ref(fig:gisadminlevelzero-png)). Repeat this process for for level one, selecting `Black Outline (1pt)`. Finally, for the level two layer, start by selecting `Black Outline (1pt)` but then click `Properties`, this update the dialog to show the full list of appearance settings. Click the color box next to `Outline color`, select `Gray 50%`, and click `Apply`. The map should now appear similar to Figure \@ref(fig:gisadjustedlayers-png).

```{r gisadminlevelzero-png, fig.cap="The appearnace of the map after the symbology of the administrative level zero has been changed", out.width = "450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis_admin_level_zero.png")
```

```{r gisadjustedlayers-png, fig.cap="The final apperance of the map after all of the administrative layers have had their symbology updated", out.width = "450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis_adjusted_layers.png")
```

Now, we will cover the administrative layer one shapefile to a raster file, and this process is the same regardless of the administrative level of a shapefile. To reduce the visual clutter of the map you may also wish to hide the administrative level two shapefile by clicking the box next to the layer name under the `Drawing Order`. 

First, we need to examine the data associated with the administrative level one shapefile. This can be done by right clicking on the layer and selecting `Attribute Table`, a spreadsheet should appear below the map (see Figure \@ref(fig:gisattributetable-png)).

```{r gisattributetable-png, fig.cap="The attribute table for the adminsitriave level one shapefile for Kenya. Note that the FID column is zero indexed with the provience Baringo being associated with the value zero", out.width = "450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis_attribute_table.png")
```

In examining the attribute table we want to first check to see if there is a numerically indexed field that we can use as the district id assignment, and what the indexing of the field is. In the case of the data from Kenya, the `FID` field could serve this role, but since it is a reserved field by ArcGIS Pro, it cannot be exported, so we are going to add our own ID field. Start by clicking the `Add` button next to the `Field:` label, this will case the dialog to shift to the fields list for the layer. At the bottom of the list of fields, type "ID" under the `Field Name` and make sure `Short` is selected as the `Data Type`, click save and the updated list should look similar to Figure \@ref(fig:gisaddidfield-png).

```{r gisaddidfield-png, fig.cap="The updated fields list after the ID field has been added", out.width = "450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis_add_id_field.png")
```

Close the `Fields` view and scroll to the right of the attribute table, the new `ID` field should be present with all rows set to zero. Since the `FID` provides a unique value for each row, we can use that as the basis for the district id. 

Start by right clicking on `ID` and select `Calculate Field`, a new dialog should appear. In the text box under `ID = ` enter "`!FID! + 1`" which will set the id to be equal to the `FID` value, plus one (if the `FID` is one indexed, then you only need to enter "`!FID!`"). Click `OK` and the `ID` column will be updated to have a unique value in for each row. 

With the `ID` column now created, we can proceed to creating the raster. Close the attribute table and then under the `View` menu, select the `Geoprocessing` option, this will load the `Geoprocessing` panel on the right side of the screen. Type "polygon to raster" and select `Polygon to Raster (Conversion Tools)` when it appears in the list, the dialog will update with the setting prompts for the tool. Next, enter the following settings:

1. Under `Input Features` select the administrative level one shapefile
2. Under `Value field` select `ID`
3. Click the folder icon next to `Output Raster Datasest`, select the databases created by ArcGIS Pro for the project (ex., `Kenya.gdb`), enter the name for the new raster (ex., `ken_admin_one`), and click `Save`
4. Click the `Environments` tab next to `Parameters` and under `Output Coordinate System` select `Current Map [Map]` this will cause the selected projection to be filled in (`Arc_1960_UTM_Zone_37N` as previously entered for Kenya)
5. Click the `Parameters` tab to return to the previous view, you will note that the `Cellsize` has changed
6. For `Cellsize` enter 5000, this corresponds to 5000 meters or 5 kilometers across the x or y axis of a cell
7. Make sure `Build raster attribute table` is checked and click `Run`

Once the calculation is complete you should see a map similar to Figure \@ref(fig:gisadminoneraster-png). Note that the scale should go from one to the number of administrative regions (47 provinces in the case of Kenya) and the symbology selected by ArcGIS Pro may be different. At this point you may wish to create another Group Layer for simulation rasters via the process previously outlined for creating the `Administrative Boundaries` grouping, move the new raster into this grouping. The rendering order of the shapefiles and rasters can be adjusted by changing their order under the `Drawing Order`.

```{r gisadminoneraster-png, fig.cap="The updated fields list after the ID field has been added", out.width = "450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis_admin_one_raster.png")
```

## Exporting the District Mapping File

Now is a good time to export the mapping CSV file by right clicking on the layer under `Drawing Order`, and selecting `Data > Export Table`. This causes a new dialog to appear, click the folder icon next to the `Output Table` and the select the location to save the CSV file (e.g., the `simulation` folder created for the project) and enter the file name *inclusive of the .csv extension* and click `Save`, click `OK` to export the CSV file and close the dialog.

Locate the CSV file on disk and open in spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel. If you are using Excel do not allow it to convert any of the data since we will be deleting most of it and changing the order. Upon loading the CSV the contents should appear similar to Figure \@ref(fig:gisexcelcsv-png). Delete all columns except for the administrative region name in English and the ID column. Once complete you should have two columns left. Next, change the order of the columns so that the ID column is first, and the English name column is second. Save the CSV file. At this point the district mapping CSV file is ready and the first row will be used as the field headings.^[ Most of the tools that use the district mapping are agnostic as to the column names, although some may expect them to be called `DISTRICT` and `NAME`.]

```{r gisexcelcsv-png, fig.cap="The data exported by ArcGIS Pro to CSV via the Export Table function", out.width = "450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis_excel_csv.png")
```

## Preparing the Population Raster

After preparing the district raster, the next step is to prepare the population raster. In doing so, there are three approaches that can be used:

1. Using an unconstrained global mosaic of populations at 30 arc seconds^[ Such as [WorldPop spatial distrubiton of poulation in 2020](https://hub.worldpop.org/geodata/summary?id=24777)]
2. Using an unconstrained national mosaic of population at 30 arc seconds^[ Such as [WorldPop spatial distribution of popuation in 2020 for Kenya at 30 arc](https://hub.worldpop.org/geodata/summary?id=32002)]
3. Using a unconstrained national mosaic of population at 3 arc seconds^[ Such as [WorldPop spaital distrubiton of population for 2020 for Kenya at 3 arc](https://hub.worldpop.org/geodata/summary?id=6530)]

These data sets are *unconstrained* meaning the processing does not attempt to restrict the population based upon building footprints or other restrictions on residency such as national parks.^[ See https://www.worldpop.org/methods/top_down_constrained_vs_unconstrained/ for more details.] For the purposes of malaria modeling, unconstrained data sets are preferable since we want allow people to move around the landscape and occupy locations that they may not typically (or legally) domicile at.

Note that each of these data sets have a resolution of arc seconds, which are 1/60th of a nautical mile or 30.87 meters are the equator. However, it is important to remember that  arc seconds of longitude decrease mathematically as one moves toward the Earth's poles. As such, it is important to remember that distortion **will** occur when projecting data that is originally supplied in degrees.

Here we are going to use second option of processing an unconstrained national mosaic of the population at 30 arc seconds (about 1 km at the equator). Start by dragging the raster on to the map, when the pop-up dialog to build pyramids (used to improve the performance of displaying the raster) and statistics appears, make sure both `Build` and `Calculate` are checked and click `OK`. After the calculations are complete, the raster should appear on the map (see Figure \@ref(fig:gisinitialpopraster-png)).

At this point it is recommended to create a new Group Layer for the raster data (e.g., "Raster Data") and to adjust the symbology of the raster to make it easier to see. Here the raster has been updated so the color scheme is inverted and the "Stretch Type" is set to "Standard Deviation" (see Figure \@ref(fig:gispopvisualupdates-png)).

```{r gisinitialpopraster-png, fig.cap="The population raster after it has been initially loaded by ArcGIS. Note that much of the map appears to be black, suggesting a population of zero.", out.width="450px", echo = FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis_initial_pop_raster.png")
```

```{r gispopvisualupdates-png, fig.cap="The population raster after it has been moved to a new Group Layer and the symbology is adjusted.", out.width="450px", echo = FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis_pop_visual_updates.png")
```

Assuming you are working with data from WorldPop, the next step is to create a new raster whose projection is in meters as opposed to degrees. Under the `Geoprocessing` tab, type "project raster" and click the `Project Raster (Data Management Tools)` command that appears. This will load the `Project Raster` tool to the right side of the screen. Enter the following:

1.`Input Raster` is the population raster that you loaded (e.g., "ken_ppp_2020_1km_Aggregated.tif" in the example, where "ppp" is population per pixel) \
2. Select `Current Map [Map]` for the `Output Coordinate System`, this will cause the map's coordinate system to be filled in, along with the correct `Geographic Transformation` \
3. The `X` and `Y` values are the cell (i.e., pixel) size, in the case of Kenya the values are both `926.456581851104`, for both of these fields enter "1000" \
4. Click `Run` \

After processing this will create a new raster and add it to the map (see Figure \@ref(fig:gisprojectedpopraster-png)). By default ArcGIS Pro will postfix the names of rasters or shapefiles with the tool used to process them (e.g., "ken_ppp_2020_1_ProjectRaster") and store them in the geodatabase created for the project ("Kenya.gdb" in this case). In most cases these are effectively temporary files and can be deleted once the workflow is complete.

```{r gisprojectedpopraster-png, fig.cap="The projected population raster, now in 1000 m resolution. Note the default symbology has again been applied by ArcGIS.", out.width="450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis_projected_pop_raster.png")
```

Next the resolution of the raster needs to be reduced from 1000 m (1 km) to 5000 m (5 km). In the `Geoprocessing` tab, type "aggregate" and click the `Aggregate (Spatial Analyst Tools)` command that appears. This will load the `Aggregate` tool to the right side of the screen. Enter the following:

1. `Input Raster` is the projected raster we just created ("ken_ppp_2020_1_ProjectRaster" in this case)
2. `Cell Factor` is the down sampling factor, since we are going from 1 km to 5 km we want to enter 5
3. `Aggregation Technique` is how the aggregation will occur, since we are working with population we want to make sure `Sum` is selected
4. Click the `Enviornments` tab at the top of the tool window so that additional options appear
5. `Snap Raster` will adjust the extent of rasters so that they align with each other, select the previously created district raster (e.g., "ken_admin_one")
6. Click `Run`

Once complete the raster should appear similar to the one in Figure \@ref(fig:gisaggregatedpop-png). However, perpetration of the population raster is still not complete since the underlying WorldPop data may contain fractional data. For the purposes of the simulation we want to ensure that all pixels contain either `NODATA` or whole integers. 

On the `Geoprocessing` tab, type "raster calculator" and click the `Raster Calculator (Image Analyst Tools)` that appears. This will cause the `Raster Calcuator` to load on the right side of the screen. In the text box enter `RoundUp("RASTERNAME")` where `RASTERNAME` is the name of the raster created by the `Aggregation` tool.^[ The reason that we round up is that we assume that any decimal value represents a whole person.] Under `Output raster` enter the final name for the raster (e.g., "ken_ppp_2020_5km") and since it will write to the geodatabase by default, you may wish to change the output location. Click `Run` and the final raster will appear (see Figure \@ref(fig:gisroundedpopulation-png)).

At this point temporary rasters created during the projection and aggregation can be deleted. You may also wish to reorganize the location of the raster to be with the previously created district raster in the group layers (see Figure \@ref(fig:gispopulationraster-png)).

```{r gisaggregatedpop-png, fig.cap="The population raster aggregated up to 5 km. Note that the data now appears slightly more pixelated", out.width="450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis_aggregated_pop.png")
```

```{r gisroundedpopulation-png, fig.cap="The output of the Raster Calcluator, note that the new raster has the final name applied to it but temporary rasters are still in place.", out.width="450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis_rounded_population.png")
```

```{r gispopulationraster-png, fig.cap="The final popuation raster, with population aggregated up to 5 km. Note the organization of the raster under the \"Simulation Rasters\" Group Layer and the storage of the raster in the geodatabase.", out.width="450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis_population_raster.png")
```

\newpage

## Prepearing the Prevelence Raster

Now that the population raster has been prepared, the next step is to prepare the *Plasmodium falciparum* prevalence raster. Typically this is done using the prevalence in individuals aged two to ten years, thus the raster is refereed to as the *Pf*PR~2-10~ raster. 

When preparing the *Pf*PR~2-10~ raster, the data from the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) is considered to be the canonical source; however, there are two things to be aware of when working with data from MAP. First, is that the prevalence raster is based upon a Bayesian space-time geostatistical model that predicts the *Pf*PR~2-10~ for each pixel in the raster [@weiss_mapping_2019]. As such, while MAP is considered the canonical source for prevalence rasters, it should not be treated as the *definitive* source of data as there may be a lag between new data publication and regeneration of the prevalence rasters. When working with MAP data be sure to note the version number associated with the raster since the underlying data likely will change over time along with the algorithm.

The second thing to keep in mind is that the national boundaries for clipping used by MAP may not be in agreement with other data sources (see Figures \@ref(fig:gismapkenyaborder-png) and \@ref(fig:gismapoverlay-png)). The underlying cause of this is the treatment of disputed boundaries and this can be a politically sensitive issue. In the case of the Kenyan data we are using as an illustrative example for this chapter, since the northern border contains the Ilemi Triangle disputed area with the territory claimed by both Kenya and South Sudan [@collins_ilemi_2004].^[ At the time of writing Kenya appears to have *de facto* control of the region.]

```{r gismapkenyaborder-png, fig.cap="The MAP Global \\textit{P. falciparum} Rate zoomed to the area of the disputed border between Kenya and South Sudan. Note the dotted gray lines indicating the disputed boundry and the sudden shift in prevelence.", out.width="450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis/map_kenya_border.png")
```

```{r gismapoverlay-png, fig.cap="The \\textit{Pf}PR~2-10~ data from map, downloaded via the \"Clip to Country\" feature with symbology adjusted in ArcGIS. Note the admin one raster is visable in the north due to the cliping boundry being smaller than boundry defined by the administrative shape boundry.", out.width="450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis/map_overlay.png")
```

Due to the discrepancy between the clipped raster from MAP and the admin one raster, we are going to produce our own *Pf*PR~2-10~ raster from MAP's global raster. Start by downloading the data from MAP, and decompress the data into a convent location (ex., a subdirectory of the `data` directory created earlier; see Figure \@ref(fig:mapglobaldirectory-png)).^[ Be aware that these will be larger files. At the time of writing the compressed file was 189 MB with the compression acting more as a convenience for bundling the 21 TIFF files additional metadata files.] Select the raster that is appropriate for the project -- typically the most recent year of production -- and drag it to the map. When prompted to calculate statistics, click "Yes". Your map should now appear similar to Figure \@ref(fig:mapglobalpfraster-png).

```{r mapglobaldirectory-png, fig.cap="Contents of the MAP global rasters directory in ArcGIS.", out.width="450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis/map_global_directory.png")
```

```{r mapglobalpfraster-png, fig.cap="Apperance of ArcGIS after the global raster has been loaded, note the use of the default color scheme.", out.width="450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/gis/map_global_pf_raster.png")
```

Since raster data from MAP is distributed with metadata, ArcGIS should recognize the raster as having a datum of WGS 1984 with an angular unit of degrees. We will start by using `Project Raster` to create a temporary raster using the projection that was selected for the country. Make sure that the `X` and `Y` values for the `Cell Size` are set to "5000" and "5000". While this will result in the loss of some data due to resampling; however, the impact will be nominal since spatial correlation will still apply.

Next, in the `Geoprocessing` tab, type "extract by mask" to search for the `Extract by Mask (Spatial Analyst Tools)`, click the result to load the tool's controls. Enter the following:

1. `Input raster` is the projected raster we just created
2. `Input raster or feature mask data` is the raster that will be used to extract data from the map, select the admin one raster
3. Enter the preferred final name and location for the `Output raster`, here `ken_pfpr2to10_2020` is used to indicate this is the *Pf*PR~2-10~ for Kenya in the year 2020
4. Make sure `Inside` is selected for `Extraction Area`
5. Select the `Environments Tab`
6. Under `Output Coordinate System` select `Current Map` to load the map's projection
7. Under `Snap Raster` select the admin one raster
8. Click `Run` to execute the tool

Once complete you should see something similar to Figure \@ref(fig:kenyapfprmasked-png). At this point you can delete the global raster that was created by projection, and high or remove the original MAP raster. It is also recommended to adjust the symbology of the *Pf*PR~2-10~ raster as well as adding it to an appropriate group layer (see Figure \@ref(fig:kenyapfprraster-png))

```{r kenyapfprmasked-png, fig.cap="Apperance of ArcGIS after the data has been extracted, note that despite the default color scheme the new raster can be distinguished.", out.width="450px", echo = FALSE}

```

```{r kenyapfprraster-png, fig.cap="Final \\textit{P. falciparum} prevelence raster for Kenya after the symbology was adjusted and the workspace cleaned up. Note the higher projected prevelnce in the disputed Ilemi Triangle region in the north.", out.width="450px", echo = FALSE}
