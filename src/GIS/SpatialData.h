   * @brief Populates dependent data structures after input data and raster
   * files have been processed.
   *
   * This function is designed to run once all necessary input data and raster
   * files have been read and processed. It performs the crucial step of
   * populating several dependent data structures that are essential for the
   * simulation's operation. These include caching the total count of districts,
   * determining the first district index based on the spatial data, and
   * creating the district lookup table. The function ensures that these
   * components are correctly initialized before the simulation proceeds,
   * guaranteeing that spatial queries and operations can be conducted
   * efficiently.
   *
   * @note This function should be called after all input and raster data have
   * been fully processed but before the simulation begins to ensure that all
   * dependent data structures are accurately populated. Failure to call this
   * function in the correct sequence may result in uninitialized or incorrect
   * data being used in the simulation, leading to potential errors or
   * inaccurate results.
   *
   * @pre Raster files and input data must be loaded and processed. This
   * includes loading spatial data such as district boundaries and population
   * distributions from raster files.
   *
   * @post The total district count is cached, the first district index is
   * determined, and the district lookup table is created and populated. These
   * actions prepare the system for efficient spatial operations and
   * simulations.
